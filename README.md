# Data-Analysis
# Machine Learning Experiments
## Project Description
This repository contains a series of self-taught machine learning experiments, showcasing my journey in understanding and applying various machine learning algorithms. The experiments are structured as individual Python scripts, each focusing on a different algorithm or machine learning technique.

## Experiments
1. **Linear Regression (Regression Prediction)** - `Experiment 8 - Linear Regression (Regression Prediction).py`
2. **K-Means Clustering** - `Experiment 2 - K-Means.py`
3. **Naive Bayes (Binary Classification)** - `Experiment 9 - Naive Bayes (Binary Classification).py`
4. **Random Forest (Regression Prediction)** - `Experiment 6 - Random Forest (Regression Prediction).py`
5. **Logistic Regression (Binary Classification)** - `Experiment 7 - Logistic Regression (Binary Classification).py`
6. **K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)** - `Experiment 3 - KNN.py`
7. **Support Vector Machine (SVM - Binary Classification)** - `Experiment 4 - SVM (Binary Classification).py`
8. **Decision Tree (Regression Prediction)** - `Experiment 5 - Decision Tree (Regression Prediction).py`

## Getting Started
These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes.

### Prerequisites
- Python 3.x
- Libraries: (list any libraries used in your experiments, like scikit-learn, pandas, numpy, etc.)

### Installation
Clone the repository to your local machine:

### Running the Experiments
Navigate to the directory containing the experiment you want to run, and execute the Python script

## Contributing
Contributions to improve the experiments or add new ones are welcome. Please read CONTRIBUTING.md for details on our code of conduct, and the process for submitting pull requests.
